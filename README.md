# README

## This is the README for "dark-cipher" - A Dark Theme for VS Code

### This theme is based on the [Blakai theme](https://vscodethemes.com/e/asilverio.blackai-visual-studio-code), A blacked Monokai based theme for Visual Studio Code.

A lot of the colors have been altered. ex:

- The Activity Bar
- Activity bar badges
- The status bar has been changed to blue
- Small thin line added at the top to separate the editor
- Line numbers - Blue / Active Line numbers - Orange

I have also added some different italics for:

- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Go
- Ruby
