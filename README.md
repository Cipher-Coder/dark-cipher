# README

## This is the README for [Dark-Cipher](https://vscodethemes.com/e/Mattaz.dark-cipher) - A Dark Theme for VS Code

This theme is based on the [Blakai theme](https://vscodethemes.com/e/asilverio.blackai-visual-studio-code), A blacked Monokai based theme for Visual Studio Code.

> In version 1.43 of VS Code, semantic code highlighting is turned on by default. Semantic Highlighting will collid with this theme's highlighting and many of the language colors will not show up. Because of this, semantic highlighting is shut off by default. If you would like to turn it on, place this snippet in your `settings.json` file. `"editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled": true` .

A lot of the colors have been altered. ex:

- The Activity Bar
- Activity bar badges
- The status bar has been changed to blue
- Small thin line added at the top to separate the editor
- Line numbers - Blue / Active Line numbers - Orange
- Tab - active and inactive
- title bar

I have also added some different italics for:

- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Go
- Ruby
