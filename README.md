# README

## This is the README for [Dark-Cipher](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Mattaz.dark-cipher) - A Dark Theme for VS Code

This theme is based on the [Blakai theme](https://vscodethemes.com/e/asilverio.blackai-visual-studio-code), A blacked Monokai based theme for Visual Studio Code.

> In the version 1.43 of VS Code, they have turned on semantic code highlighting as the default option. Semantic Highlighting will collid with this theme's highlighting. If you want to keep the sematic highlighting that VS Code has, then do nothing. However, if you would rather utilize this themes highlighting, simply turn off the semantic highlighting feature by adding `"editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled": false,` to your settings json. 

A lot of the colors have been altered. ex:

- The Activity Bar
- Activity bar badges
- The status bar has been changed to blue
- Small thin line added at the top to separate the editor
- Line numbers - Blue / Active Line numbers - Orange
- Tab - active and inactive
- title bar

I have also added some different italics for:

- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Go
- Ruby
